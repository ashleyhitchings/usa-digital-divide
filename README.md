# Visualizing the Digital Divide
*Data visualization and report in Python on U.S. internet and broadband disparities*

Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, schooling has moved virtually entirely online, illuminating and magnifying pre-existing disparities in broadband, internet access, and technology infrastructure across the U.S. Undergirding the education-related digital divide is a broader broadband issue, wherein 23% of Americans lack broadband access (Pew Research Center, 2021). As described by BroadbandUSA:

> In the 21st century, broadband is basic infrastructure just as vital as roads and bridges, electrical lines and sewer systems. At the community level, an advanced telecommunications network is critical for driving growth, attracting new businesses, creating jobs, enabling access to emergency services, and remaining competitive in the information-age economy. At the individual level, access to broadband – and the know-how to use it – opens the door to employment opportunities, educational resources, health care delivery, government services and social networks. In many cases, broadband is necessary for applying for a job or even completing a homework assignment. 

Here, I undertake an exploratory data analysis to create salient visualizations and draw insights about the following areas of inquiry. In the U.S. today, where do people have broadband access, which demographic groups have broadband, how has broadband access changed over time and across groups, and to what extent does wealth influence the digital divide?

### Provenance
I cleaned and constructed the following visualizations in Python using the NumPy, Pandas, and Altair data science libraries. Survey and time-series data were collected from Pew Research Center's "Internet and Broadband Fact Sheet" data files updated in April 2021, and income and geospatial data were collected from BroadbandUSA's county-level "Indicators of Need" data portal as of June.

### Visualizations

Based on county-level data compiled by BroadbandUSA from the FCC and Microsoft, the vast majority of American households have access to home internet. As shown in the figure, while the West Coast and Northeast have high rates of home internet access, with most counties at 80% coverage or higher, large bands of the deep South and geographic pockets in the Midwest have counties where 30-60% of households lack home internet, especially in rural regions of the country or those with high poverty levels. The digital divide is more pronounced when analyzing broadband speeds; excluding urban pockets and the two coasts, most counties in the U.S. had fewer than 50% of households using internet at broadband speeds, even where home internet was accessible.

In the U.S. today, just over three-quarters of adults have access to home broadband, and large disparities exist across demographic groups. Differences in access are the most pronounced across education and income levels: only 46% of adults with less than a high school degree having home broadband access compared to 94% of college graduates, and just 57% of adults earning under $30,000 annually had home broadband versus 92% of adults earning $100,000 and above. Additionally, rural Americans, racial minorities—especially Hispanic adults— and individuals of lower income and education levels are those that are least likely to have home broadband access in 2021. Meanwhile, white adults, college graduates, those living in the suburbs, and individuals earning over $50,000 annually overwhelmingly had access to home broadband, with rates of access of 80% and above.

Based on the time-series data, disparities in home broadband access have persisted from the early 2000s to the present, with substantial differences in coverage across household income levels, education levels, races, and community types. At the same time, American adults across all groups have seen substantial increases in broadband access on a year-over-year basis over the last two decades. As with the prior visualization, adults with higher income and education levels, who are white, or live in a suburb or urban community have the highest rates of home broadband access. However, percent-wise differences in access have generally decreased across all demographic groups since the mid-2000s, with sharp increases in the percent of adults who are Hispanic, live in rural communities, or who have attended some high school between 2018 and 2021.

Finally, there appears to be a moderate positive correlation of R = 0.6813 between the percent of a county’s population living under the poverty line and the percent of households with no home internet access. The correlation coefficient of 0.7417 represents that, on average, a one percentage point increase in the percent of a county’s population living in poverty is associated with a 0.74 percent increase in the percent of households with no income access. Broadly, counties with higher poverty rates tend to have a lower percent of households with internet access, and counties with more affluent populations tend to have higher internet access rates, according to the last figure. These trends also broadly apply on a regional basis, as the population distributions for poverty mirrored those for lack of home internet access. In particular, counties in the Northeast had the lowest range for poverty and lack of internet access, with a relatively low percent of individuals under the poverty line and lacking home internet. Meanwhile, there counties in the Midwest, South, and West saw greater variation at the extremes.
